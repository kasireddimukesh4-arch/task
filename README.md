ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Overview

I created a simple, responsive landing page using:

HTML for structure (layout of the page)

CSS for styling (colors, fonts, layout, responsiveness)



---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Files Used

index.html â†’ Contains the content of the website.

style.css â†’ Controls how the website looks.



---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Main Sections of the Page

Your landing page has 3 main parts:

1. Header

Includes a logo and navigation menu.

Uses Flexbox to arrange items side by side.

On smaller screens, the navigation becomes vertical.



2. Hero Section

This is the main attraction of the page.

Includes a large heading, a short paragraph, and a button (call-to-action).

Uses center alignment and spacing to draw attention.

Background has a soft color or gradient.



3. Footer

Located at the bottom of the page.

Contains copyright info.

Also has links to social media.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Styling Techniques Used

Font and Colors:
You applied a clean font and modern color palette (blue, white, gray, etc.)

Flexbox Layout:
Used Flexbox to align items horizontally (in header) and center content (in hero).

Spacing and Padding:
Added spacing between elements using padding and margin to improve readability.

Hover Effects:
When the user hovers over a link or button, the color slightly changes.



---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Responsive Design

You made the page mobile-friendly by:

Using the viewport meta tag for scaling.

Adding media queries to change layout on smaller screens.

Navigation menu stacks vertically.

Font sizes become smaller.

Elements re-align for better fit.
